# Pass props to React Router's Link component

```
<Link to={{
  pathname: '/tylermcginnis',
  state: {
    fromNotifications: true
  }
}}>Tyler McGinnis</Link>
```

> Now, the component thatâ€™s being rendered for that route (in this case, `Profile`) would be able to access `fromNotifications` by accessing `props.location.state`.

```
class Profile extends React.Component {
  state = {
    user: null
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    const { handle } = this.props.match.params
    const { fromNotifications } = this.props.location.state

    fetch(`https://api.twitter.com/user/${handle}`)
      .then((user) => {
        this.setState(() => ({ user }))
      })
  }
  render() {
    ...
  }
}
```

To recap, there are two ways to pass data from a `Link` through to the new route: URL parameters and `state`. URL parameters work great for strings, but break down after that. By making the Links to prop an object, you can pass along any sort of data you need under the `state` property and that data can be accessed in the new route under `props.location.state`.
